#eXpansion User Interface
	The leading idea for whole user interface is to provide clean, powerful but still easy of use Interface that you 
	just can just use with ease. The learning curve should be quite low.

	Interface Highlights:
		* Windows can be moved, like in desktop systems!
		* Basic server functions accessible using mouse
		* Graphical admnistrating of the server, no need to remember chat commands
		* But familiar chat commands still available (90% of Fast and XAseco commands are same)

#Menu access
