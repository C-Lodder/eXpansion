Here is a few useful tips to make server administration easier for you.

As currently there is no way to fetch infos on dedicated server files using
dedicated API, the files needs to be configured manually in order to
auto-save the changed values for next server restart.

`/adm settings` --> click tab `Config files`

fill in your `match settings`-file and `dedicated_cfg.txt`-file
and the `server settings`-file.

the `Server setting`-files are very powerful, as all expansion settings are
saved & loaded from them, this means also active plugins. There is already
defined some for, like match or minimal configs for plugins.
