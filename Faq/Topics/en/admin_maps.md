#Admin: How to add and remove maps in a server ?
Fast way to add/remove current map from current playlist is to use chat command:
**/adm remove this** or **/adm add this**

You can browse, add map to current maplist or delete a map from disk:
	[Menu] --> Maps --> **[Add maps]

Maps can be removed from the current playlist using
	[Menu] --> Maps --> **[List maps]

#Remember
The server controller doesn't save your maplist automaticly! to save the maplist go to:
	[Menu] --> [Server management] --> [Match Settings]
and either create a new maplist or use the [Save]-button to save the list.
